### Description:
I take an Idea and build upon it.

#### Idea #1:
Make a program that saves what text you type into a ".txt" file.  
Also, I have an increasing want to make this "cross platform", so it would work on Linus and Mac Computers in the future.

##### Reason:
Cuz why not.

### Made:
This was started on Visual Studios 2019 on 2020-05-03

#### Websites that Helped Making This:

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/case-insensitive-string-comparison-in-cplusplus
https://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/9600/

### Plans:
Eventual name change.  
Making something that works.
